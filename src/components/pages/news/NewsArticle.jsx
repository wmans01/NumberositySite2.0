Last season, only 8889A attended, making an unforgettable run as Tournament Finalists alongside powerhouse team Boogie Woogie, who held the Skills World Record at the time.

This time, 8889A returned to continue their legacy, while 8889B and 8889S stepped up to the plate, determined to make their own mark on one of the most competitive stages in VEX.

Hosted by Team 2011, one of the top-ranked VEX programs in the world and Division Champions at the 2024 VEX World Championship, LAUNCH brought together elite teams like Overclocked, Boogie Woogie, Full Circle, and Run It Back. The stakes were high‚Äîbut so was the energy.

Despite a tough start and a string of early losses that placed them #27 in rankings, 8889A didn't back down. They came roaring back, clinching the Skills Champion title and catching the attention of 2011D Dopamine, who chose them as an alliance partner for the elimination rounds.

In the finals, facing off against the formidable duo of Boogie Woogie and Full Circle, the underdogs rose to the occasion. With a perfect blend of strategy and robot reliability, 8889A and Dopamine emerged victorious as Tournament Champions, punching their ticket to the 2025 VEX World Championship in Dallas!

But the celebration didn't end there:

    8889B and 8889S, both first-timers at a Signature Event, made it into the elimination rounds and gained invaluable experience competing among the world's best.

We're beyond proud of all three teams for representing Numberosity Academy with resilience, sportsmanship, and heart. A special shoutout goes to our coach and chaperones, whose time and support made this incredible journey possible.

With LAUNCH behind us, all teams are fired up to continue their VEX journey‚Äîaiming higher and pushing harder toward the challenges ahead. üöÄüí™`,

Team 8889A, paired with 74947K Fenix ‚Äì Karma, battled their way to the semi-finals of the Winchester Division. There, they faced off against their friends Team Holy Cow from Ontario, Canada, in a high-energy showdown that came down to just a few points.

While we didn't advance to the finals, the event was about more than just the scoreboard. We had the opportunity to speak with university teams, learning about their design processes, strategies, and innovations. These inspiring conversations sparked new ideas that may shape our own future robots!

We were also featured in an interview by Pits and Parts, marking our first spotlight since the WPI WAVE event‚Äîbe sure to check it out!

This trip wasn't just another competition‚Äîit was a milestone in our season and a moment of growth. From new friendships to fresh inspiration, RiverBots reminded us of why we love VEX: the challenge, the collaboration, and the never-ending journey of improvement.

After being unexpectedly removed from the WAVE waitlist just days before the event, Team 8889A dove straight into preparation for their debut at a Signature Event. Despite limited time to fine-tune their robot, they debuted a brand-new design and a fresh autonomous routine, pushing the boundaries of their performance.

The team worked tirelessly to boost their robot's speed and tackle more complex autonomous tasks‚Äîso much so that their robot even followed them into their dreams! However, despite their best efforts, 8889A ranked 34th in the tournament. But there was a silver lining. They were selected by the #1 seed 10102A from Vinic Robotics, a team with personal significance to 8889A (they had once shared the same team number in middle school). Together, they advanced to the second round of eliminations, where they faced off against strong Texas teams who went on to become finalists.

While the tournament didn't end as they hoped, the team has reflected on their performance and remains confident in their new robot's potential. This setback has only motivated them further, and they're more determined than ever to improve and continue pushing the limits of their design.

Congratulations to Void and Zero Gravity for winning the tournament championship and qualifying for the 2025 VEX World Championship!
